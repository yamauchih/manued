<H3>Abstract:</H3>
<DIV CLASS="ABSTRACT">
 Manued is a method for proofreading of manuscripts, proposed by Ikuo
 Takeuchi in No.39 Programming symposium in Japan. Manued is a media
 independent proofreading method, however, it is especially effective
 for exchanging electronic text via E-mail. This document introduces the
 manued method and <TT>manued.el</TT> which is an emacs lisp
 implementation for supporting <TT>manued</TT> method. I wish this
 method and <TT>manued.el</TT> will be a help for the people who feels
 some difficulty to exchange a manuscript via Email with their editor or
 colleagues.

<P>
For the present, revising electric manuscripts is not easy as revising
them on a piece of paper with red ink. Especially, in Email
environment, it is hard to revise a manuscript since the kinds of usable
characters are limited. However, many people want to exchange
manuscripts by Email via the Internet. Conventionally, many people
may use a method for revising an electric manuscript like below.
<PRE>
    The Three Laws of Robotics by Azimuth.
                                  ^^^^^^^
             This may be a mistake for Asimov. And the number of
             laws was changed from three to four, wasn't it?

    1. A robot may not injure a robot, nor through inaction
                                ^^^^^ This must be "human being"

       allow a human being to come to harm.
</PRE>

<P>
This conventional method indicated correcting position with a symbol
`' and proofreading plans with a text. This conventional method
always needs much input work and some kind of ambiguous is included in
it, because proofreading plans are directed by natural language.  The
main problem of this conventional method comes from this
ambiguous. Even if the manuscript is already inputed in a computer,
this ambiguousness interferes automatic extraction of the revised
document. Furthermore, information of correcting position with `'
sometimes may be no mean when the mail reading environment is changed.
For example, someone reads a manuscript with proportional font and the
other one does not. In other words, there is the case that it is
difficult to specify a correcting point since each person has own
environment to read an Email including a manuscript.

<P>
Proofreading of Manued method solves these problems. The input for
designation of proofreading is relatively easy, and it can define
exact designation of the correcting region and how to change the text.
Therefore, there is no fail to miss the correcting position. And there
is no mis-recognition of the proofreading text that is a comment or a
substitution. In particular, on of the advantages of manued method is
independence from environment. We should only assume the manuscript is
written as a text file.

<P>
Manued has two main notation of proofreading rule. One is ``delete and
insert'' rule. This is shown with notation of [original text
(delete) /revised text (insert) ; comments ]. Therefore, above
text will be changed as follows.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The Three Laws of Robotics by <code>[</code>Azimuth/Asimov; This may be a
  mistake with Asimov. And the number of laws was changed from three
  to four, isn't it?<code>]</code>.  1. A robot may not injure a
  <code>[</code>robot/human being<code>]</code>, nor through inaction allow a
  human being to come to harm.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Of course, we can use this method with a piece of paper and a
pen. However, we assume only an editor to edit a text file. Although,
I implemented ``manued-minor-mode'' on the Emacs editor to make manued
method more usefully. In manued-minor-mode, we can use following kinds
of functions.

<UL>
<LI>Extracting the original document or the revised one from one
  manued document automatically
</LI>
<LI>Searching the proofreading position
</LI>
<LI>Assistance for inserting manued commands
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Since manued method does not care environment, assisting tools for
manued method can be implemented on other editors. Just only because I
always use the emacs, I implemented the tool on the emacs. So, please
inform me if you implemented an assistance tool for manued method on
other environment. Examples of demanded environments are as follows.

<UL>
<LI>vi

<LI>Microsoft Word
</LI>
<LI>Filter commands for extracting revised document, etc.

What is Manued?</A>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00041000000000000000">
Outline of Manued</A>
</H2>

<P>
Manued is a method for proofreading of manuscripts, proposed by
<A NAME="tex2html1"
  HREF="http://ne.cs.uec.ac.jp/tak.html">TAKEUCHI, Ikuo</A>
in
No.39 Programming symposium in Japan&nbsp;[#!bib:Takeuchi1998!#]. Manued
stands for MANUscript EDiting Language (and there is another
origin. Takeuchi is interested in `Nue'. This is an imaginary creature
of Japan. Ma-nue-dou has special meaning in Japanese). The aim of this
method is to achieve easy proofreading with exchanging a manuscript
via Email.(<A NAME="tex2html2"
  HREF="./manuscripteditting.txt.gz">Here is original text in
  Japanese on the Web.</A>)

<P>
When we revise a manuscript sent by Email, there are some problems as
follows.

<UL>
<LI>We cannot use the special symbols like hand written characters
  for the proofreading a manuscript. The kind of Email
  usable-character-set is limited.
</LI>
<LI>We usually can not use colors.
</LI>
<LI>Some mail reader does not keep two dimensional information of
  document. When author's mail reader and editor's one are different,
  it is not guarantee that positioning information of the document is
  the same. One famous implementation of such mail reader is
  Eudora. This is not Eudora's defect. Originally Email protocol (RFC
  822) does not have any rules about character width, fonts and how to
  display breaking lines. Therefore, these situations can usually
  occur.
</LI>
<LI>We do not want to depend on line feed position. To send exact
  correction information, we want to avoid the effect of editor
  software's line feed processing algorithm for a long line, which
  depends on each editor program.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
To solve these problems, we used to exchanging printed paper including
proofreading information with red ink via snail-mail. However, this
method takes too long time and we have already high-speed
Email. Using facsimile is another solution since it has acceptable
transmission speed, but receiver must inputs corrections by reading
pieces of paper with his/her eyes. So, some errors will be mixed to a
manuscript by human error, and input costs for human being is very
high. There is the OCR technology for recognizing hand written
characters, but it seems that is not matured for general using. In the
end, it seems not a good idea to change the media of the manuscript
from electric stuffs to printed papers.

<P>
[#!bib:Takeuchi1998!#] says that proofreading for an electric text
should have next features.

<UL>
<LI>Both revised document and original one are extracted
  automatically. (required)
</LI>
<LI>High readability for human being.
</LI>
<LI>Correction points should be easily found.
</LI>
<LI>We can put some comments for revised region.
</LI>
<LI>It should be easy to put revision information to a manuscript.
</LI>
<LI>Repeated correction directive should be abstracted.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Manued is proposed to satisfy these features and this stands for
MANUscript EDiting language. The author presents an implementation to
support proofreading with this language.

Let me show you some simple examples.

<P>

  <ul>
  <li>He was <b><u><font color="#ff0000">killed</font></u></b>

  <li>When ``Norwegian <b><u><font color="#ff0000">woods

  <b><u><font color="#ff0000">1</font></u></b> of my friends says that the

  right?
  <li>Why do people say ``chapter <b><u><font
  color="#ff0000">first</font></u></b>''?
  </ul>

<P>
I emphasized the point which I wanted to correct in this
text. However, some browsers may not express them. I want to correct
above text as follows.

<P>

  <ul>
  <li>He was <b><u><font color="#ff0000">skilled</font></u></b> at programming.
  <li>When ``Norwegian <b><u><font color="#ff0000">wood</font></u></b>'' is
  translated to Japanese, it is always
  <b><u><font color="#ff0000">interpreted</font></u></b>
  as ``a forest in Norway''. However,
  <b><u><font color="#ff0000">one</font></u></b>
  of my friend says that the
  <b><u><font color="#ff0000">right</font></u></b>
  meaning is a furniture made in Norway. Please tell me which is
  right?
  <li>Why do people say ``chapter
  <b><u><font color="#ff0000">one</font></u></b>''?
  </ul>

<P>
To do this with conventional method, for example, we correct as
follows.

<P>
<PRE>
He was killed at programming.
       ^ skilled. This small missing "s" is fatal!


When ``Norwegian woods'' is translated to Japanese, it is always
                     ^ delete s. I love the Beatles.

^ interpreted.                                     ^ Of course one is one,
                                                     but write `one'.

says that the light meaning is a furniture made in Norway.
              ^ right.

Please tell me which is right?


Why do people say ``chapter first''?
                            ^ one. (I have also same question but
                                    one is right.)
</PRE>

<P>
To display this conventional descriptions for browsers, I use special
tags to preserve two dimensional information like verbatim (for LaTeX)
or pre (for html). However, in Email environment (RFC 822), there is
no such special directives and this conventional descriptions using
`' symbol may corrupted. For example, the same information will be
shown in the next paragraph without the tags which preserves two
dimensional information. The representation of above text will be
varied with each environment, since usual browser ignores successive
white spaces and line feeds. Some people can understand next
documents, but the others see meaningless texts. It will be clear at a
glance that this is not beneficial for the people who can not read
next text.

<P>

       skilled. This small missing "s" is fatal!

<P>
When ``Norwegian woods'' is translated to Japanese, it is always
                    delete s. I love the Beatles.

<P>
interpretented as ``a forest in Norway''. However, 1 of my friends
&#238;nterpreted.                                   &#212;f course one is one,
                                                     but write `one'.

<P>

              right.

<P>
Please tell me which is right?

<P>
Why do people say ``chapter first''?
                            &#244;ne. (I have also same question but
                                     one is right.)

<P>
In addition, even if an environment can preserve two dimensional
information, it is hard to distinguish among correction information,
only the comment and original text.  Moreover, first you corrected the
latter part of your manuscript and second you correct former part of
the manuscript, latter corrected parts are sometimes shifted. In such
situation, you must maintain the manuscript for keeping consistency of
two dimensional information of revised position. This is not easy way.
It is also stressed that cut and paste manipulation may be harmful for
conventional method.  Proofreading with Manued is independent from two
dimensional information and can resolve conventional method using ''
symbol.

<P>
In Manued method, there are two replacement rules shown as follows.

<P>

<UL>
<LI><code>[A/B]</code> : This means `delete A and insert B'.
  The variations are
  
<OL>
<LI><code>[A/]</code> : Delete A (delete A and insert nothing).
</LI>
<LI><code>[/A]</code> : Insert A (delete nothing and insert A).
  
</LI>
</OL>
</LI>
<LI><code>[A|B|C]</code> : Swap A with C, so result will be `CBA'.  
<BR>The variation is
  
<OL>
<LI><code>[A||C]</code> : Swap A with C.
  
</LI>
</OL>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
According to above rules, the example texts will be presented as
follows.

<P>
You can see this method is stronger than conventional method. Do you
understand the overview of Manued? If there is a tool which proceeds
these rules, manued method will be more powerful and
useful. Therefore, I implemented <TT>manued.el</TT>, this program
supports manued method. <TT>manued.el</TT> has next functions :
highlighting correction regions, searching manued directives,
inserting manued directives, extracting revised document and original
one.

Manued command and Manued definition commands of
  correction symbols</A>
</H2>

<P>
In Manued, there are ``definition commands of correction symbols'' and
``manued commands''.  ``Definition commands of correction symbols'' is
to avoid dependences of different environments and ``manued commands''
is to indicate proofreading points. We also call definition commands
of correction symbols as def-command, because these commands are
started with string `def'. Def-commands define proofreading symbols in
a manuscript. To correspond to next circumstances, def-commands is
defined by Manued.

<UL>
<LI>Since usable characters are limited in Email environment, the
  characters indicating correction points with Manued will be varied
  according to a document.
</LI>
<LI>It is almost same with above, if fixed correction characters are
  used for indicating proofreading point by manued, some environment
  forces to use too many escape commands. This will degrade
  readability of manued document. We want to avoid this situation with
  using def-commands.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Def-command is always put in the beginning of document and must be put
at the beginning of line. When it is not put at the beginning of line,
Manued does not recognize they are the def-commands. The names of
definition commands of correction symbols are `def' plus each manued
command name. For example, `delete and insert' command is defined by
`defdelete' def-command.

<P>
When you want to set delete command symbol as `*', you should insert
next line in your document.

<P>
<PRE>
        defdelete *
</PRE>
Then correction region will be written as next.
<PRE>
        [original text*revised text]
</PRE>
This means delete `original text' and insert `revised text'.

<P>
When your document has no def-command, default characters are used
that suggested in [#!bib:Takeuchi1998!#] by Ikuo TAKEUCHI. I will
also show the default def-commands in next the section.

<P>
This section explains the def-commands.

<P>
Def-commands always appears in a proofreaded document as follows.
<PRE>
        defparentheses  [ ]
        defdelete       /
        defswap         |
        defcomment      ;
        defescape
        deforder        newer-last
        defversion      0.9.5
</PRE>
I will show the each line meaning and default values of each
def-commands.

<P>

<UL>
<LI>defparentheses
<BR>This def-command defines the start string and end string of manued
  command.  (default value `<TT>[ ]</TT>')
</LI>
<LI>defdelete
<BR>This defines manued command of delete and insert. In default, delete
  the former part of this symbol and insert the latter part of this
  symbol. For example, <TT>[A/B]</TT> means delete A and insert
  B. You can exchange the delete part and insert part, see also
  deforder.  (default value `<TT>/</TT>')
</LI>
<LI>defswap
<BR>This defines manued command of swap. For example,
  <code>[A|B|C]</code> means A and C will be swapped and results is
  CBA.  (default value `<code>|</code>')
</LI>
<LI>defescape
<BR>This defines manued command of escape. For example, [This is
  <code>~</code>[foo<code>~</code>]/These are <code>~</code>[bars<code>~</code>]] will be
  delete ``This is [foo]'' and insert ``These are [bars]''.  However,
  too many escapes are very complicated to read. To avoid this, you
  can re-define manued command strings by using defparentheses.  For
  example, write ``defparentheses { }'', we can rewrite below to
  {This is [foo]/These are
  [bars]}.  (default value `<code>~</code>') 
<BR>Here, you must pay attention that escaped symbol is starting manued
  command strings only when it is not in manued command. This is avoid
  complicated situation like below.
<PRE>
        The ratio $a_n/b_n$ must be considered here.
        ~[\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{a_n}{b_n} \]
</PRE>
  If any manued command symbol is treated in any place, all manued
  command in original text must be escaped. In this time, '/' of
  <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="45" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1.png"
 ALT="$a_n/b_n$"></SPAN> and ] is corresponding to manued command symbol. But these
  symbol is not in manued command. It is too complicated to escape
  them all. To avoid such situation, `starting manued region strings'
  is the only escape target (in here, `[') in plain text.
</LI>
<LI>defcomment
<BR>This defines comment of manued command. Latter part of this symbol
  in manued command will be ignored.  (default value `<TT>;</TT>')
</LI>
<LI>deforder <A NAME="item:deforder"></A>
<BR>This defines newer part of delete command. In defdelete command of
  the manued method, the deleted part is called as the `older' part,
  and the inserted part is called as the `newer' part. The list in
  delete command is ordered as [first/last]. You can decide which is
  delete part.  So, these (newer older) and (first last) combinations
  will be next 4 types.
  
<UL>
<LI>newer-first
</LI>
<LI>newer-last
</LI>
<LI>older-first
</LI>
<LI>older-last
  
</LI>
</UL>
  This deforder of definition commands of correction symbols is only
  define attribute of delete command, and does not define any manued
  command symbol.  (default value `<TT>newer-last</TT>')
</LI>
<LI>defversion
<BR>This def-command shows the version information for
  <TT>manued.el</TT>.  This is useful information for the
  <TT>manued.el</TT> program.  (default value `(manued-version-num)')
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Definition commands of correction symbols should be located the top of
a corrected manuscript and each def-command must be located at the
beginning of line. If a manuscript does not include these
def-commands, the default manued symbols will be
used. <TT>Manued.el</TT> checks consistency of def-commands and warns
to the user when consistency is broken, for example, if defparentheses
has only one argument, manued.el warns it.

<P>
Nest of these commands is possible, and process is done from the
inside. However, non interpretable list of manued command is an error.
For example, it is an error that there is no defRparenthesis
corresponding to defLparenthesis, or it is also an error like

When you extract the new document with manued, do you want to modify the
extracted part? For example, when you use a markup language and you want
to emphasize the proofreading part with the language.  If yes, there is
a way to modify the extracted part.

<P>
First, you type
<PRE>
  M-x manued-set-pretty-print-on
</PRE>
and, you apply some Extracting document commands. I will describe this
with next Example 1.

<P>
Example 1: Extract from <code>[A/B;C]</code> to
<code>\colortext{blue}{A}\colortext{red}{B}\colortext{green}{C}</code>.
Namely, when you want to add some colors at revised parts with TeX.
<PRE>
(setq manued-pretty-print-format-delete-list
  '("\\colortext{blue}{%s}" "\\colortext{red}{%s}" "\\colortext{green}{%s}"))

This should be included in your <TT>.emacs</TT> or <TT>.manued.el</TT>.
The elements of this list correspond with each part of delete command
like next:
<PRE>

<PRE>
 (setq manued-pretty-print-format-delete-list

<P>
In manued, the comment part is optional and it is not needed.
Therefore, when there is no comment in manued expression,
the comment part format string is not outputed in default.
However, this behavior is controlled by the variable
<code>manued-pretty-print-null-comment-out-p</code>.
Here, we describe only about delete command, but also the way to control

Short history of <TT>manued.el</TT></A>
</H2>

<P>
<TT>manued.el</TT> is an Emacs lisp program for supporting the Manued
proofreading method. Manued method itself is an easy proofreading
method for correcting electric texts. Next features are considered to
support for this method: emphasizing manued command (e.g. using
colors), extracting revised text and original text. <TT>manued.el</TT>
offers to add colors to manued commands, to search correction points,
to extract revised text and original text and to support manued
command inputs.

<P>
I (the author of <TT>manued.el</TT>) have been interested in Lisp
language since I took the Masahiko SATO's class of functional
language.  At that time, I was an master candidate. However, I have
not written any Lisp programs before writing <TT>manued.el</TT>. I
sometimes tried to write lisp program, but I always failed because I
also have no program which I really want to write and I had no friends
who is a lisper. There was the HCL (Hokkaido Common Lisp) in my
laboratory on Omron's Luna 68k, but I just touched it at a time and I
forget it.

<P>
Several years are passed, I must exchange manuscripts to correct with
research colleagues of Tohoku University via Email. I felt high
unpleasant for that work. First, I printed out a manuscript and
checked it by red ball-point pen. Second, I inputed correction
points.

<P>
Moreover, I supervised a student. One day he send me his draft of his
master thesis. The time of correcting work reaches several hours and
the time of input work was taken more hours. I used conventional
method for correcting manuscript. However, we can not avoid errors
with human being inputing them and misunderstanding of comments will
be occurred since correction symbol was vague in the conventional
method.

<P>
In that days, I joined the programming symposium and heard the idea of
Manued by Ikuo TAKEUCHI. Instantly I was fascinated this idea. I
thought this is the program to write in Emacs lisp. I guessed many
people in the hall of programming symposium agree that idea. Professor
TAKEUCHI commented that ``This program may be very easy to
implement. I think the fourth grade student entered his/her graduation
thesis can be accomplish to write this program.'' I heard this comment
and I thought this should be a good exercise to start writing lisp
program for me. Fortunately, I have the best teacher to learn lisp and
offer <TT>manued.el</TT> here. His name is MAEDA Atusi. I thank him.

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00071100000000000000">
When def-command harms TeX compilation.</A>
</H3>

<P>
I hope that I can compile the output of show-newer-command
immediately.  (First, you apply manued-show-newer-in-manued-buffer to
the current buffer. Second, you write *manued* buffer which is result
of the command to foo.tex file by using M-x write-file. Finally you
compile `foo.tex' file.) However the compilation may fail because of
manued def-commands. One solution is not to use def-command in the
manuscript and to set manued-def-* variables by elisp startup
file(<SPAN  CLASS="textit">.emacs</SPAN>).  But one of the meanings of def-command is to
keep consistency between the def-command symbols and the manued
commands within the document. Therefore, it is not a good idea to
eliminate def-command header, especially a manuscript is exchanged via
Email since this is just the case that such consistency should be
kept.

<P>
<TT>manued.el</TT> can recognize extended def-command which is
attached with some strings at top of def-command. You can set the head
strings of def-command to <SPAN  CLASS="textit">manued-defcommnd-head-str-list</SPAN>. By
default, this list includes `%' and `%%' which is the comment symbols
of TeX. Next code is recognized by <TT>manued.el</TT> as
def-command. However, a manued command must be put at the beginning of
line and should not include blank between the head string with the
manued command. You can also customize
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">manued-defcommnd-head-str-list</SPAN> to change the header string.

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00071200000000000000">
When TeX option is deleted with manued processing</A>
</H3>

<P>
Because the default manued command starts at `<code>[</code>' and ends with
`<code>]</code>', this is same as the TeX option argument. I always use
Japanese environment, I change the `<code>[</code>' and `<code>]</code>' to 2bytes
parentheses character. However, people use ASCII environment may not
use such method. So, one of this solution uses some special strings
instead of `<code>[</code>' and `<code>]</code>'. Next setting is one example.

Other implementation of manued.el (By Prof. WADA)</A>

<P>
Takeuchi and I introduce another implementation of manued on ``bit''
No. 12, 1999. Prof. Wada also implemented it on emacs. Why are two
manued implementations represented on the same editor (emacs)? I don't
know the exact reason, however, I think emacs is one of the most easy
way to implement an interactive text processing tools.

<P>
This section introduces the implementation of manued by Prof. Wada.
This implementation focuses to ``see'' the manued document and much
smaller than my implementation. This compactness allows to send a
manuscript with the code to whom a person did not install
<TT>manued.el</TT> and the person can instantly use it.
